    <h3>the dragon year</h3>
    I've been thinking about dragon. And Chinese puppet theatre. It's newly the dragon year! In celebration, I decided to make a dragon puppet, and theme it against two inspirations:
    <br>
    First, the shadow puppets: 
    <img src=puppet.png width="40%"> 
    <br>
    <img> 
    <br>
    Second, the dragon dance:
    <img src=dance.png width="40%"> 
    <br>
    Here, I was inspired by the movement of the dragon. Since each segment of the body is operated by a person underneath, to show motion, the dancers jump to staggered differences in height: One higher, one lower, one higher, one lower. 
    <h3>designing the dance</h3>
    I wanted the dragon to have the Shadow puppetry strings coming from above, and experience the same every-other lift and lower as the Dragon Dance. Hence, I sketched this: 
    Essentially, the design would break down to a few elements. First, the dragon would be split into 5 parts, and the body would be trapezoidal and alternating. Second, there would be a structure holding the dragon to itself; either strings or the laser-cut bendable cardboard. Third, there would be strings running upwards to (fourth!) a rotating rod. 

    <img src=sketch.png class="imgcenter" width="90%"> 
    <h3>fabrication!</h3>
    I lasercut the sketch pieces on 1/8th inch wood, on the SEC machines. This was crucial, as the SEC uses Adobe Illustrator as an intermediary between print stages, which is more fit for the drawing+shading that I have to do for this more organic form!
    However, the task was still so long... Since they had more than one machine, and (at the time!) only one instruction sheet in the room, I mismatched the instruction to the machine, and ended up having to cut it several times. Cleaning up the image (in pixels)
    that a vector was also a long process. I learned how to work with outlines and offsets, tools galore.
    <br>
    Here were the pieces: 
    <img src=pieces.jpg class="imgcenter" width="90%"> 
<br>
I attached string to each segment of the dragon and wound it around the rod. For every other segment, I winded the string counterclockwise to the last segment, which would induce this movement in the video below:

<br>
Unfortunately, the movement is not as smooth. This is because of a combination of factors! One, I used waxed string (Ooops). Two, I didn't space the dragon parts far enough for actual elevation to be possible. They were too tight horizontally to vary vertically. Three, the dragon parts were not weighted enough. In the future, I'll definitely change those factors! But for now, I do love this little (jaggedly) dancing dragon, and hope you do too!
