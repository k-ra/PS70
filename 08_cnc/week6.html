    <h2>octopus!</h2>

    <p>At first, I considered textures with low depth, such as the moon's surface (from afar!) or a water or ripple
      pattern. However, I assumed that if I kept my CNC cut to a small area, I could achieve more depth and complexity with it.
      Thus I turned to the door knockers.
    <br> Inspired by old metalworking and fantastical, frightful creatures, I gathered some inspiration photos on the Octopus.
      I wanted to CNC an octopus with 6 legs, and then attach the remaining 2 legs into the middle, to form the ring of a door knocker.

    <p> Here was my fusion vector sketch. This was quite difficult to do, since no leg was the same, and I decided to texture it with elevations of eyes and tentacle grippers.

  <h3>The CNC Part</h3>
  <p> I projected my part onto a sketch, converted it into a DXF. Then, I imported it onto the CNC software on the PC and had to do a series of moderations. First, I tried to pick the 0.0675 bit, but someone had lost the key to loosening the machine! Hence, I did end up using the 0.125 bit already inside. Second, I added an offset and punched in the elevations so that there would be a tall moat around my octopus. This is how it turned out:

  <p> I'm very proud of it! I am a retired ceramicist, but as soon as I get my hands on some clay, that would be my preferred way of using this mold. I would roll a block of clay over this six-legged octopus, and get a perfect print! Thanks for joining :)
