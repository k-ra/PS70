    <h2>microcontroller MOBILE!</h2>
    <p><b> ideation part 1: inspiration and drawing </b> </p>
This project, like last week's, was also string based! However, I added a servo motor, circuitry, and code.  I wanted to make a children's mobile with charms that moved up and down. 
I started off by designing the charms:
<img src=charms.jpeg class="imgcenter" width="60%"> <br>
And here was the drawing that I made to convert to DXF vector files: 
<img src=dxfcharms.png class="imgcenter" width="50%"> <br>
As for the mobile, I did some research on existing structures. I realized that they have fixed lengths because the strings are tied around the round enclosure. However, I wanted them to move! Hence, I decided to make the plate connect to the center, which would tie and connect all the strings, and then be controlled by a servo (microcontroller)! It would translate rotational motion (90 degrees of it) onto linear motion (height of the mobile).

<p><b> fabrication part 2: laser cutting and fishing wire </b> </p>
I went ahead and laser cut it on acrylic here:

I assembled it with fishing wire for the invisible look. I tried to put two charms on every other string!

Here it is without any microcontrollers yet. This is the linear motion I wanted to achieve for all of the charms on the baby mobile, at once!

<p><b> microcontroller part 3: coding and circuitry </b> </p>
t was a challenge to find a servo at the end of the semester, which is why I was ecstatic about the idea to repurpose my final project. It's also a kinetic sculpture; all together it's a big kinetic sculpture! 
Thus, I repurposed the servos of my final project, but wrote new code and shifted the circuitry away from music, and towards motion. This way, there was a rube-goldberg-esque large machine, with one part moving the other. I didn't expect it to be so visually cohesive!
I coded for both of the wings to flap in sync, counterclockwise to eachother. I tied all the strings to the top flapping wing, and set it into motion! (Code is embedded below!)
Here it is all together:

I'm really proud of the end result!

This was my servo flapping code:
