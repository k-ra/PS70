    <p>The MEMS I got working with help from Kassie and PhannyPac, but achieved similar results. When listening on the serial monitor, the signal was very sporadic and would only reflect larger volumes (shouting Ahh!) after random times, and sometimes not at all. This made it difficult to consider using this directly for my final project, since it was a little unreliable. However, every time the volume spiked, you could be sure that a large volume WAS detected (i.e. no false positives, but a lot of false negatives). Hence, if you put a limit or threshold of volume as an activation method for a function call, keeping quiet would be a sure fire way to reliably *not* trigger it.
