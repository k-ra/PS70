    <h2>microphone [zone under construction]</h2>

    <p> When discussing with Nathan, we realized that the easiest way to sense direction in a small body
      (thinking of a hamster sphere!) is to have a single microphone sense if one area is louder than the other. Hence,
      the control flow would look a little like this: the mic would sample every 2 seconds while the robot is running in
      one direction. If the final area is louder than the other, the direction was correct; if not, it would circle
      back. Since the robot's greatest intended output is its ink footprint, I'll refine this process so the route looks
      nice on paper :). For our purposes here, we can abstract this mission like so:</p>


    <p>Configure and code a microphone so it samples sound every 3 seconds. If the latter sampling is
      LOUDER than the earlier, than the LED will be ON. If not, it will turn OFF. This is an example of the decision
      making that the robot will make.</p>
