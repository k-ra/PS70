    <h2>Week 9: Radio, WiFi, Bluetooth (IoT) </h2>
    <h4>Microcontroller Communication</h4>

    This week I worked with <a href="https://chris-rivers.github.io/PS70/09_networking/index.html">Chris</a> and <a
      href="https://kirafagerstrom.github.io/ps70/about.html">Kira</a> on a Firebase-ESP32 communication device to play
    <a href="https://k-ra.github.io/twomolewhackamole/">Two Mole Whack-a-mole</a>! Below is our
    shared documentation copied to each of our websites.<br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color:#e2165b;"> <a href="https://k-ra.github.io/twomolewhackamole/">Two-Mole-Whackamole &#169;</a></h3>
    For our networking project this week, we decided to make a project using Firebase. The basic idea was to make a
    rudimentary version of the game Whac-A-Mole, using a circuit with an LED on it. The LED (meant to be the mole) would
    go on at a random time within a set interval, and then pressing a button on the circuit to turn off the light would
    get you points based on how long it took you to "whack" the "mole". Each player's points would be calculated in
    Arduino and then sent to a Firebase database, before finally being displayed on an html website. <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Setting up Firebase</h3>
    The first thing we tackled was setting up a remote database for the project using Firebase. We followed this
    <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-firebase-realtime-database/">tutorial </a>on RandomNerd to help
    us with that. It was pretty simple beyond the generic setup because all we needed to
    store was a score nested in a node for each player. The Arduino IDE code (included in full code below) from the
    RandomNerd tutorial sent a float and random integer from the ESP to the database every 15 seconds, and we tested our
    connections/circuit by manually changing database values to see if they were reflected in the Arduino IDE serial
    monitor. It worked!<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Making a website interface</h3>
    We used <a href=â€https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/09_networking/index.htmlâ€>Nathan's html code</a> to
    create an web interface that would display the Whackamole score for each player. We modified the basic setup code
    slightly to add references to the Player 1 and Player 2 scores in the Firebase RTDB, and event listeners to
    automatically update scores as the game continues (using the document.getElementById function). Kyra added a super
    cute pair of moles and formatting.

    <h3>Programming the ESP32</h3>
    We ended up with a fairly simple circuit containing 2 buttons, 2 LEDs with one 1kOhm resistor each, and an ESP32
    Wroom on a LOLIN32 board.

    <br>
    Here are the pin and LED connections to the ESP32 board (pins must have digital write and digital read capacity/both
    input and output).
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> Player 1: Button 1 (pin 33) and LED 1(pin 32) </li>
      <li> Player 2: Button 2 (pin 26) and LED2 (pin 25) </li>
    </ul>
    We modified the code from the earlier RandomNerd tutorial so the Firebase configuration is the same, but we added
    variables for the buttons, LEDs, scores, players, and LEDonTime in the setup, and programmed the game according to
    the following logic: turn the LEDs on at a random time, record the amount of time between the LED turning on and the
    button press, and convert that into a score.
    INSERT ARDUINO CODE HERE

    <h3>Demo</h3>
    Here is a video of the Firebase RTDB updating the score according to how fast the button is pressed:
    INSERT DEMO VIDEO

    <h3>Future Iterations</h3>
    Work was started to make the LED more mole-like: the plan was to use a solenoid attached to a mole figure so it
    could pop up and down, but this hasn't been finished yet.
