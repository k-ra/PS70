      2D Imagination
    </h3>
    <p>
      Given how joyfully open-ended the prompt was, I spent some time thinking over my infinite options! These are some
      potential future projects that I was able to sketch up:

      <b>1. 3D Printed fashion element</b>, a la current tech-fashion trends. I'm inspired by Iris Van Herpen, who uses
      organic
      material as inspiration to 3D print textiles and flexible forms on the human body. I'm also inspired by some of
      Zac Posen's "husks", almost, where the entire dress is 3d printed and static, instead of in motion. I find the
      doll-like
      rigidity of his dresses quite funny and pleasing. I'd like to move through life as if I've just been excavated out
      of an
      ice sculpture. The sketches I did were quite elementary; one was just to figure out the shape of a dress, and the
      other
      was an embodiment of the sparkle emoji in a two-piece: &#10024.

        <b>2. Creative stand</b>, for my toothbrush, my pen, or any other object that wishes to stand on a fancier
        pedestal
        than it has currently. I imagined a Greek Ionic stand, or an opening flower with petals canting outwards.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <b>3. Ivory sphere-within-a-sphere</b>, inspired by this ancient feat of carving with lace pearls within
        spheres, all
        carved out of one block of ivory. This piece is currently held at the National Palace Museum in Taipei. 3D
        printing this, in comparison, would be easy! However, it would mostly be a feat for imagining what printing
        support structures would be easiest to excavate!

    <h3>Chosen Project: Opera Headpiece</h3>
    <img src="headpiece.png" width="30%">
    <img src="realfeather.png" width="30%">
    <p>
      The one I settled on was the <b>Peking Opera Headpiece</b>, inspired by the feathers and bobbles attached
      to the incredibly intricate and dynamic costumes in Peking Opera!
