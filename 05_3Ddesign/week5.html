      2D Imagination
    </h3>
    <p>
      Given how joyfully open-ended the prompt was, I spent some time thinking over my infinite options! These are some
      potential future projects that I was able to sketch up:

      <b>1. 3D Printed fashion element</b>, a la current tech-fashion trends. I'm inspired by Iris Van Herpen, who uses
      organic
      material as inspiration to 3D print textiles and flexible forms on the human body. I'm also inspired by some of
      Zac Posen's "husks", almost, where the entire dress is 3d printed and static, instead of in motion. I find the
      doll-like
      rigidity of his dresses quite funny and pleasing. I'd like to move through life as if I've just been excavated out
      of an
      ice sculpture. The sketches I did were quite elementary; one was just to figure out the shape of a dress, and the
      other
      was an embodiment of the sparkle emoji in a two-piece: &#10024.

        <b>2. Creative stand</b>, for my toothbrush, my pen, or any other object that wishes to stand on a fancier
        pedestal
        than it has currently. I imagined a Greek Ionic stand, or an opening flower with petals canting outwards.

      <div class="column">
        <b>3. Ivory sphere-within-a-sphere</b>, inspired by this ancient feat of carving with lace pearls within
        spheres, all
        carved out of one block of ivory. This piece is currently held at the National Palace Museum in Taipei. 3D
        printing this, in comparison, would be easy! However, it would mostly be a feat for imagining what printing
        support structures would be easiest to excavate!

    <h3>Chosen Project: Opera Headpiece</h3>
    <img src="headpiece.png" width="30%">
    <img src="realfeather.png" width="30%">
    <p>
      The one I settled on was the <b>Peking Opera Headpiece</b>, inspired by the feathers and bobbles attached
      to the incredibly intricate and dynamic costumes in Peking Opera! This was my most ambitious 3D modeling yet, and I'm proud of it!

    </p>
    <h3>Thinking Process</h3>
    How about, instead of telling you like always, I drew out a little progress chart for today? See below for how I made the skeleton, flexible little feathers on top of the opera hat, and from scratch! (No subtraction at all :)
    <img src="reasoning.png" class="imgcenter" width="70%">
    Amazing!! Now that we've got that, let's go behind the scenes to Fusion 360, where I spent most of my time making sure the ball and socket joints lined up, had exactly the millimeters it required for clearance, and much more!
    <h3>Fusion 360 Behind the Scenes</h3>
    I used extruding, sketching on different planes, cutting, boring, measurements, circular patterning, and lots of other different techniques for this ball-and-socket flower joint!
    
    This was my ball and socket joint at the beginning, with the ball being 8mm and the socket being slightly larger.

    Here was the process of making the petals, which taught me a lot about 3D modeling!:

    Here is the flower after I transferred the mesh into PrusaSlicer:

    <br>

    Onto the headpiece! This was definitely the hardest to look aesthetically pleasing; I went for an industrial crown look. It's the modern day! Go Bauhaus!

    Now comes the tragedy. 

I was supposed to first print two test flowers, and see if they could fit together correctly. Tragically, all the 3D printers had moved out of the room!!! Though I'm devastated that I couldn't do the exact printing part, but I have done printing throughout the semester and previously, before the class.  

For example, I did help 3d print parts for the drawing machine, and also have printed a little heart locket, a bird whistle, and a working recorder mouth. I am also quite proud of the 3d modeling and the creativity behind my design.
