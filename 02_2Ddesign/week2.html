    <b>Tuesday, Jan 30th</b> Autodesk finds me troublesome <br>
    <p>
      My journey begins from behind the start line, where I had to wrangle with Autodesk for approximately a week. I
      briefly learned some Rhino, which means I learned how to make sketches and transform them!

      I tried to import a vector drawing as a DXF file, to get around the temporary software lock-up. I learn that the
      laser cutting settings here are slightly different than the ones in the SEC, where I previously printed little
      trinkets directly from vector files in pngs (Figure 1: my tiny tigers). After drawing a little hungry bunny as a
      keychain and importing it directly into Rhino, I realize that rasters don't print directly (at least I didn't know
      a way), and everything has to be a vector in order to be marked 'CUT', 'SCORE', or 'ENGRAVE'.
    </p>

    <b> Thursday, Feb 1st </b> I overcome it with love
    <p>
      
      I sketched this heartbox! It has to be done in two pieces, since the flatlay of the box construction overlaps in a
      couple of places. The squiggly lines indicate places where the fingerlocking would take place. The lines within
      the heart
      indicate my original design for compartments, which I ran out of time to actually execute but will be circling
      back to implement.
      I really liked this process of designing the flatlay of a non-rectangular prism! Another option was to make it an
      actual curved
      symbol of a heart and use the scoring technique to bend cardboard. However, I decided to try fingerlocking to join
      the rest of the class!
      <br><img src=heartbox.png width="35%" /><br>
      You can see my original design for the top would have two wings sticking out as handles, and the lid inset within
      the box. There would be notches cut into the sides of the heart for the handles to rest. However, I eventually
      leaned towards the flip-up design!
    </p>
    <b> Tuesday, Feb 6th: </b> I design the thing<br>
    <p>
      My original sketch had wings as handles, with the wings resting on notches on the sides. Unfortunately, I found
      myself a little culturally distanced from the "heart with wings" notion, and was unsure if I was really that type
      of person. Hence I decided for a simple peep-hole with a modern curved heart. It serves the purpose, as it
      indicates that the box is a heart, not a right angle or (worse) an L!

    </p>
    <b> Thursday, Feb 8th: </b>Translating into reality!<br>
    <p>
      The fingerlocking design I landed on was more minimalistic, with three joints per edge! I measured the thickness
      of the box and made the height of everything slightly above that (to account for error and for fire burning the
      material away)./
      <br>
      At the laser printer, I spent a good few hours orienting the design, as it kept printing two times smaller! I
      discovered it was because someone prior had shifted the printer settings. Shout out to Nathan for discovering
      this!
      <br><img src=lilheart.JPG width="35%" /><br>
      I also learned that the laser printer software, UVX, treats whatever perspective is frozen on the screen at the
      time of "Command P" as the actual flatlay design. Due to this, my first print was two times smaller AND slightly
      less than
      orthogonal. All the angles were infinitessimally off.
      <br>
      Which means the entire plan printed as if I was a slightly off-center bird, looking down. It sported these skewed
      angles, 96 instead of 90 degrees, imperceptively off-putting.After diagnosing this, I was able to execute the same
      fixes from then onwards!
      <br>
      Assembly was rather painless, though I should have creased it before putting it together! Because the material
      longed to flatten, I put discreet little dots of hot glue at the corners to keep it sturdy. Then I was done! Phew!

    <h3>
      Learning Fusion
    </h3>
    <p>
      Here are my images from my first tutorial, the lego brick one from Product Design Online from Youtube. I altered the block to be square, and readjusted the dimensions.
      <br>
      <img src=square1.png width="35%" />
      <img src=square2.png width="20%" />
      <img src=square3.png width="35%" />
      <br>

      Here are the pictures from my second, the continuation from Youtube. I altered the bottle to be a curvy green glass bottle, like from the beach!

    <h3>
      Fusing Fusion with Reality
    </h3>
    <p>
      I decided to make this dining hall cup, a shape that feels like it belongs in a nursery, a home, and a nursing
      home:
      <br>
      <img src=bottle1.png width="35%" />
      <img src=bottle2.png width="35%" />
      <br>
      I've always found it off putting, so I appreciated getting the chance to know it better. Now I think it's
      comfortingly strange. It's not wobbly enough to be entirely abstracted into a shape, and not finger-memory enough
      to be ergonomic. It's not consistent with its diameters, as it starts thin at the bottom and slowly ends up
      expanding, only to contract imperceptibly at the top. The squiggle is dramatic but not enough to be a doll-house
      toy. It's everything in between. Thank you!
