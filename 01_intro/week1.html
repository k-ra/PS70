    <h1>week 1: final project ideas</h1>
    <p class="margin">
      I'm mostly thinking more towards design and art than use, but that can shift as the weeks go on.

    <h3>genie</h3>
    <img src="fishbot.jpg" height="200vh"> <img src="eagle.jpg" height="200vh">
    <p class="margin">
      A beautiful, tiny (safe) flying object akin to a magical animal friend, often spotted on the shoulders of
      princesses. I'm not sure what it would do yet. Maybe it would be wearable, and perch on your arm, and then take
      off when you lift it? Like an eagle? Maybe it could pick something up, or sense something and report back?
      This build would use 3d printing, laser cutters, waterjets for the body construction; circuitry, motors, sensors
      (ultrasound etc.) for movement; coding to make it run!
    </p>


    <h3>carving</h3>
    <img src="woodcut.jpg" height="200vh">
    <p class="margin">
      Woodcut printing robot. Autonomous woodcut-printed ball. Like an omnidirectional wheel except the tracks print and
      make art. The wheel itself will respond to some sort of user input, either controlled (via web app or injected
      code) or autonomous (via motion sensors etc.)
    </p>


    <h3>mobile</h3>
    <img src="mobile.jpg" height="200vh">
    <p class="margin">
      Baby mobiles will come back. Let's have a motor control the height and rotation of dangling objects (use
      to-be-determined) to help us reconnect with our infant pasts. The position of everything would change depending
      either on a motion sensor, or with time/sunlight, or some other factor tbd. It could be a new kind of clock;
      a new way of physicalizing time? Precedents in human history include sundials, sand machines, analog clocks,
      digital digits, and infinitely more. Could I come up with a physical installation which would react to weather,
      time, and/or another input? Maybe light and projections, shadow shows?
      This would use various machines for construction (laser cutter, waterjet, 3d printer), electronics and motors for
      movement, and coding to set it into motion!
