<h1>week 1: thinking ahead</h1>
<p class="margin">
  Final project brainstorming! I'm mostly thinking more towards design and art than use, but that can shift as the weeks go on.

<h3>timing</h3>
<p class="margin">
  I wonder about a new way of physicalizing time. Precedents in human history include sundials, sand machines, analog clocks, digital digits, and infinitely more. Could I come up with a physical installation which would react to weather, time, and/or another input? A new type of clock? I'm imagining this would be fabricated out of wood, from the laser cutter, rotating, and hopefully design-oriented.

<h3>genie</h3>
<p class="margin"> 
  A beautiful, tiny (safe) flying object akin to a magical animal friend, often spotted on the shoulders of princesses. Except it'll keep a wide berth (at least in the beginning) in case of hair, or some other unnecessary human thing. Maybe it will speak, and say a mix of encouragements and snark.

<h3>carve</h3>
<p class="margin"> Woodcut printing. Autonomous woodcut-printed ball. Like an omnidirectional wheel except the tracks print and make art. The wheel itself will respond to some sort of user input, either controlled or autonomous via motion input.</p>

<h3>mobile</h3>
<p class="margin"> Baby mobiles will come back. Let's have a motor control the height and rotation of dangling objects (use to-be-determined) to help us reconnect with our pasts. The position of everything would change depending either on a motion sensor, or with time/sunlight, or with </p>
